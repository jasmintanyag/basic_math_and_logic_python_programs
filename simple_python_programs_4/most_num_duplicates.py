# Prog02: Create a program that ask user to input a number, continue asking until the user input is invalid. Display the number with the most number of duplicate.

# initialize variable to store how often the number repeats
# create infinite loop to continuously ask user to input numbers
# count how often the number occur
# add 1 to count if the number already exists
# initialize count to 1 if it's the first appearance
# stop the program when there's invalid input
# identify the number that has most duplicates
# print the most frequent num
# else, print "there's no valid number entered"
