# Prog08: Create a program that ask user to input 10 numbers. Print how many are odd numbers.

# initialize odd count to 0 before the loop
# loop from 1 to 10
# ask the user to enter a number 10 times (since the range is 10)
# convert the input to a float
# check if the number is not divisible by 2
# if it is not divisible, add 1 to odd count 
# print the odd count
