# Prog06: Create a program that ask user to input 10 numbers. Print the result of the first number minus all of the remaining numbers.

# initialize total difference to 0 before the loop
# loop from 1 to 10
# ask the user to enter a number 10 times (since the range is 10)
# convert the input to a float
# if it's the first number, add it to total difference
# else, subract the number from total difference
# print the total difference
